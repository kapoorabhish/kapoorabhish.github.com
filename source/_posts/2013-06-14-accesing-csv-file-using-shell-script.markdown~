Given a text file in which there are links of file to be dowloaded (one link per line), here I am posting a shell script to achieve the task.

{% codeblock %}
myfilename=/home/abhishek/Desktop/ideas.txt		#here path to txt file has been stored in $myfilename
	while read line
	do
		curl --remote-name $line

	done		<$myfilename
{% endcodeblock %}

The above shell script reads the ideas.txt file line by line and download all the files in the current directory.
