Increasing file upload size of PHPMyAdmin is a very easy task.  
Just open the file /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
{% codeblock %}
$ sudo gedit /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
{% endcodeblock %}

Search for "upload_max_size" and make it to the required upload limit.
{% codeblock %}
upload_max_size=20 M 		//here I make it to 20M
{% endcodeblock %}

Next search for "post_max_size" and make it to some size greater than "upload_max_size".
{% codeblock %}
post_max_size=25 M 		//here I make it to 25M
{% endcodeblock %}


Next you restart the apache server.
{% codeblock %}
$ sudo service apache2 restart
{% endcodeblock %}

And it's done.
