I work on Lubuntu-10.04. Accidentally I removed the desktop panel two days back. In short I lost all the icons on the panel.<br>
I added all the icons back (which I possibly could!).
One big problem I faced is ,I was helpless, "How to turn on the WI-FI, since I could not find the icon for it."
The only icon I could found was for Ethernet.<br>
So here is the solution.<br>
First I discovered that my wifi was not ON.
I tested it with the command
{% codeblock %}
$ ifconfig
{% endcodeblock %}

The only ethernet interface was ON.<br>

So after that I tried this command.
{% codeblock %}
$ sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
{% endcodeblock %}

And got the error.

		SIOCSIFFLAGS: Operation not possible due to RF-kill


Now, needed to pay attention to RF-kill.<br>
First checked the status of Rf-kill managed devices.

{% codeblock %}
$ rfkill list
{% endcodeblock %}

Output.

		0: hci0: Bluetooth
			Soft blocked: no
			Hard blocked: no
		1: phy0: Wireless LAN
			Soft blocked: yes
			Hard blocked: no
		2: tpacpi_bluetooth_sw: Bluetooth
			Soft blocked: no
			Hard blocked: no



which says wi-fi is soft-blocked.<br>
So solved this problem by
{% codeblock %}
$ sudo rfkill unblock wlan 
{% endcodeblock %}

now the output is

		0: hci0: Bluetooth
			Soft blocked: no
			Hard blocked: no
		1: phy0: Wireless LAN
			Soft blocked: no
			Hard blocked: no
		2: tpacpi_bluetooth_sw: Bluetooth
			Soft blocked: no
			Hard blocked: no



now, there was no error in ifconfig.
{% codeblock %}
$ sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
{% endcodeblock %}

now, it's time to know the network in range. So
{% codeblock %}
$ sudo iwlist wlan0 scanning
{% endcodeblock %}

Now time to add icon for wi-fi.<br>
So, go to desktop panel settings and add "Manage Networks" plugin.
