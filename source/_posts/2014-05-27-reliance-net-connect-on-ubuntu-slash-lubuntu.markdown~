I just got a Reliance Net Connect from one of my friend and tried it to run on Lubuntu. The task was so easy. It took me to run just few commands.

You need to install two software packages to make the internet connectivity work. They are wvdial and gnome-ppp (The front-end tool to configure wvdial).

1.Installation of "wvdial"
{% codeblock %}
sudo apt-get install wvdial
{% endcodeblock %}

2.Install gnome-ppp
{% codeblock %}
sudo apt-get install gnome-ppp
{% endcodeblock %}

3.Open gnome-ppp from the terminal.
{% codeblock %}
sudo gnome-ppp
{% endcodeblock %}

4.You have to enter your reliance 10-digit mobile number in the Username & your password. Select #777 if you are a Reliance Netconnect Broadband+ user. Then press the Setup button below.

5.In the Setup window below, click the “Detect” button to identify the device ID of the USB port in which you have inserted your USB modem. The tool would automatically detect the Device, Type and Speed of your USB modem. Once it has deteced, please the “Close” button below.

Once this is done click on Connect!!!
