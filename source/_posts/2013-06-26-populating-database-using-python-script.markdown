I am having an excel file which contains near about 11000 rows,from which I needed to populate my database, so I tried the following Python Script.

``` ruby populate.py
	import xlrd
	import MySQLdb

	# Open the workbook and define the worksheet
	book = xlrd.open_workbook("ITCHS_2012.xls") 	#open the excel file 
	sheet = book.sheet_by_name("ITCHS")		#name of the sheet


	# Establish a MySQL connection
	database = MySQLdb.connect (host="hostname", user = "username", passwd = "pwd", db = "batabase")

	# Get the cursor, which is used to traverse the database, line by line
	cursor = database.cursor()


	# Create the INSERT INTO sql query
	query = """INSERT INTO final4 VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)"""


	# Create a For loop to iterate through each row in the XLS file, starting at row 2 to skip the headers
	for r in range(1, sheet.nrows):
		itc=sheet.cell(r,0).value
		description = sheet.cell(r,1).value
		hs4   = sheet.cell(r,2).value
		hs5   = sheet.cell(r,3).value
		hs6  = sheet.cell(r,4).value
		hs8 = sheet.cell(r,5).value
		policy  = sheet.cell(r,6).value
		conditions=sheet.cell(r,7).value
		# Assign values from each row
		values =(itc,description,hs4,hs5,hs6,hs8,policy,conditions)
		# Execute sql Query
		try:
			cursor.execute(query, values)
		except:
			pass



	# Close the cursor
	cursor.close()


	# Commit the transaction
	database.commit()

	# Close the database connection
	database.close()
```



You just need to create a table first in the database and run the above script.
In the above script I have used the variable names according to field names of my table.
